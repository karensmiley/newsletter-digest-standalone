## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection

### Setup

1. **Create a CSV file with your newsletter subscriptions:**

   Create a file named `my_newsletters.csv` with the following format:

   ```csv
   Newsletter Name,Website URL,Category,Collections, Author
   The Generalist,https://thegeneralist.substack.com,Business,,
   Stratechery,https://stratechery.com,Technology,,Andrew Sharp
   Not Boring,https://notboring.substack.com,Business,Tech Favorites
   Exponential View (Azeem Azhar),https://www.exponentialview.co/,AI & Machine Learning,SWAI,Chantal Smith
   ```

   **Required fields:**
   - `Newsletter Name` - The name of the newsletter
   - `Website URL` - The Substack URL (e.g., `https://newsletter.substack.com`)

   **Optional fields:**
   - `Category` - For grouping articles (defaults to "Uncategorized")
   - `Collections` - Additional tags or groupings (optional, not currently used)
   - `Author` - Only include articles by a specific author for a newsletter. Put the full or partial author name to match in the column. Blank for a row means no author name matching on that newsletter.
   
   **Note:** Currently only supports Substack newsletters with public RSS feeds.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Windows logging configuration**
   To prevent encoding issues when logging output to a file on Windows, use this command first:
    set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf_8   

That's it! You're ready to go.

## Output Format

The digest includes:

### ✨ Featured Articles
Top-scored articles with:
- Numbered list (1, 2, 3...)
- Full title with link
- Newsletter name and author
- Engagement stats (comments, likes)
- Days since publication
- Article summary
- Engagement score

### 🎲 Wildcard Pick (optional)
A random article from the next 10 highest-scored articles - helps surface hidden gems!

### 📂 Categorized Sections
Remaining articles grouped by category:
- Business
- Technology
- Culture
- etc.

Each article shows:
- Title with link
- Newsletter name
- Engagement stats
- Days since publication and date of publication

## How It Works

### Data Sources
1. **RSS Feeds** - Gets article titles, links, dates, content (public, no auth)
   ```
   https://newsletter.substack.com/feed
   ```
2. **HTML Parsing** - Extracts engagement metrics from article pages
   - Parses Schema.org structured data in meta tags
   - Gets `comment_count` and `like_count` (reactions)
   - **No API calls** unless overridden in runstring - complies with Substack TOS

### Scoring Algorithm

You can choose between two scoring methods:

#### 1. Standard Scoring (Default - Recommended)

**Formula:**
```python
engagement = (comments × 3) + likes
length = (word_count / 100) × 0.05
raw_score = engagement + length
normalized_score = scale to 1-100 range
```

**Best for:**
- Highlighting articles with most total engagement
- Finding evergreen content that remains popular
- Weekly/bi-weekly digests with older articles
- Balanced view across publication dates

**Key features:**
- Articles with 0 engagement still get scored based on length
- All scores normalized to 1-100 range for consistency
- Longer articles always rank above zero

**Example:**
- Article with 50 likes, 2000 words = high engagement + length score
- Article with 0 likes, 3000 words = low score but not zero
- Article with 5 comments, 500 words = medium-high score

#### 2. Daily Average Scoring

**Formula:**
```python
engagement = (comments × 3) + likes
daily_avg_engagement = engagement / days_since_publication
length = (word_count / 100) × 0.05
raw_score = daily_avg_engagement + length
normalized_score = scale to 1-100 range
```

**Best for:**
- Highlighting fresh, trending content
- Daily digests where recency matters
- Identifying articles gaining momentum
- When you want newest content prioritized

**Key features:**
- Same length scoring as Standard
- Divides engagement by age in days
- Favors recent articles with moderate engagement over older articles with high engagement

**Example:**
- Article from 7 days ago with 50 likes = 7.1 engagement/day + length
- Article from today with 10 likes = 10 engagement/day + length
- Today's article likely wins! 🏆

#### Shared Settings

**Weights (both methods):**
- **Comments: 3×** (deeper engagement signal)
- **Likes: 1×** (standard engagement)
- **Length: 0.05 points per 100 words** (ensures non-zero scores)
- **Score range: Always normalized to 1-100**

**To customize scoring:**
Edit the constants in `digest_generator.py` around line 250:
```python
COMMENT_WEIGHT = 3      # How much to weight comments (default: 3×)
LIKE_WEIGHT = 1         # How much to weight likes (default: 1×)
LENGTH_WEIGHT = 0.05    # Points per 100 words (default: 0.05)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "UnicodeEncodeError"
- Happens on Windows when logging output to a file without setting the default encoding
- Solution: set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf_8

### "CSV file not found"
- Make sure `my_newsletters.csv` is in the same directory
- Or provide the full path when prompted

### "No articles found"
- Try increasing the lookback period (14 or 21 days)
- Some newsletters publish infrequently
- Check that CSV has valid Substack URLs

### "HTTP errors" during fetch
- Some newsletters may be temporarily down
- Script will skip and continue with others
- Normal to see a few failures in large lists

### Engagement metrics are zero
- Article may genuinely have no engagement yet
- HTML parsing may have failed for that specific article
- Articles are still included, just scored lower

## Customization

### Scoring Weights

To customize the scoring model, edit `digest_generator.py` around line 250:

```python
# SCORING CONFIGURATION - Edit these to change the scoring model
COMMENT_WEIGHT = 3      # How much to weight comments (default: 3×)
LIKE_WEIGHT = 1         # How much to weight likes (default: 1×)
LENGTH_WEIGHT = 0.05    # Points per 100 words (default: 0.05)
```

**Effect of changes:**
- Increase `COMMENT_WEIGHT` to prioritize discussions over passive engagement
- Increase `LENGTH_WEIGHT` to give more weight to longer, substantial articles
- All scores are automatically normalized to 1-100 range

### HTML Styling

Edit styling around line 300+ in `digest_generator.py`:
- Font sizes
- Colors
- Spacing
- Border styles

### Article Limits

- **Featured count**: Set via CLI prompt
- **Articles per category**: Edit line ~350: `articles[:10]`
